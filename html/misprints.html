This errata list aims to collect together all those which have been found. <P> Throughout the DM4, 'Giovanni Ricardi' should be changed to 'Giovanni Riccardi'. My particular apologies to Giovanni, whose work on Italian-language Inform has been tireless. [GN]<P> &sect;1.11, p.&nbsp;29: The code to print a slash on the next letter is "@/" rather than "@\". [KB]<P> &sect;2.5, p.&nbsp;45: The diagram of the parsing array seems to be incorrect. Entries 4 and 5 should contain "3" and "2" (length and position of "GET"), and entries 8 and 9 should contain "2" and "6" (length and position of "IN"). Also, on p.&nbsp;481 the answer to Exercise&nbsp;81 wrongly refers to &sect;2.4. [RF]<P> &sect;7.3, p.&nbsp;98: The description of SHOWOBJ says that it can take an object number as its argument; this is not true. [RF]<P> &sect;23, p.&nbsp;174: In the Treasure class definition, the reference to '(the) second' should be '(the) noun' or '(the) self' -- at this point 'noun' refers to the Treasure object and 'second' refers to the packing_case. [RF] <P> &sect;33, p.&nbsp;238: This might be an appropriate place to mention the constant MANUAL_PRONOUNS, which appears not to be documented. [RF] <P> &sect;36, pp.&nbsp;260-261: Twice, the DM4 says that the Unicode number for a copyright symbol is 9A. The copyright symbol number is really A9. [ES] <P> &sect;40, p.&nbsp;290: In the last sentence of the first para, the word 'to' is missing from the phrase 'report it to the author'. [RF] <P> &sect;42, p.&nbsp;309: In the para beginning 'There are four output streams for text...', the clause '..."script on" switches it off;' should read '..."script off" switches it off;'. [SK] <P> &sect;A2, p.&nbsp;412: The n_to entry does not mention that the value can be a string. [RF] <P> &sect;A2, p.&nbsp;412: In the add_to_scope entry, the second mention of PlaceInScope should perhaps be AddToScope. Also, AddToScope should appear in &sect;A3 on p.&nbsp;419, and in the Index. [RF] <P> &sect;A2, p.&nbsp;416: In the heading for the description of the 'orders' property, there should be the 'plus-in-a-circle' symbol meaning 'additive'. [CK] <P> Table 2B, p.&nbsp;520: The escape sequences for ZSCII characters 203, 204, 213 and 214 are respectively @/o, @/O, @cc and @cC, rather than as shown. [RF]<P> Table 5, p.&nbsp;523: The definition should read 'Lowstring&nbsp;&lt;new-name&gt;&nbsp;&lt;text&gt'. [RF]<P> Index, p.&nbsp;555: The entry for 'Richard Dyer' should appear under D as 'Dyer, Richard'. [GN] <P> Index, p.&nbsp;557: The entry for 'special (grammar token)' points to p.&nbsp;222, but no information is provided there.
